## Arch Linux Installation

This repository contains a detailed Arch Linux installation guide that I personally wrote to help you install and configure Arch Linux from scratch.

This is how I set up Arch Linux myself. My approach is based on the official Arch Wiki and best practices, combined with my own experience.

Keep in mind I am also a beginner and learner, so some mistakes might happen along the way. Feel free to provide feedback or improvements!

**Note:** This installation process has been tested both on a virtual machine and on a real laptop, ensuring it works in different environments.

By following the topics above and adapting them to your needs, you can successfully install a clean and minimal Arch Linux system, just like I did.
